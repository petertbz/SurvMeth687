## Project requirements

Each team will be responsible for working on the following tasks throughout the semester (maximum points on the final project for each task are indicated in
parentheses):

1. Research Question (5 points): Formulating a methodological or substantive research question that can be addressed using one of the modeling techniques discussed in the class, including 1-2 (maximum) important pieces of literature motivating the research question;

2. Data Set (5 points): Briefly describing the data set and its structure, identifying variables in the data set that you will analyze (possibly including complex sample design features), and presenting simple (yet appropriate) descriptive statistics for each of the variables;

3. Modeling Approach (20 points): Specifying and clearly defining an appropriate statistical model for analyzing the data and answering the research question (being extremely careful with notation), and describing the general modeling approach;

4. Software Coding (10 points): Selecting software that you can use to fit the model and writing appropriate code that will compute the estimates of interest;

5. Interpretation and Inference (30 points): Correctly interpreting the modeling results, assessing model diagnostics / quality of fit, and making appropriate inferences with regard to your research question(s); and

6. Analysis Report (80 points total): Drafting a brief analysis report that describes Sections 1 through 5 above in clear detail (including model notation), including overall conclusions (10 points), interpretation of results, and software code used (clearly commented in a required Appendix)

The final report for each topic should be submitted for grading through Canvas (only), no later than **5:00pm** on the due date indicated in the syllabus. The reports will be graded with respect to: 1) Parts 1 through 6 above; 2) the clarity of the material presented; 3) the quality of the technical writing and the English grammar; and 4) correct interpretation of the results. Figures and tables can certainly be used to enhance the report and describe the data being analyzed or the results of interest. Analysis reports should be double-spaced, using **12-point font, and no more than 10 pages long, including all equations, tables and figures (tables and figures will not be allowed in appendices)**. This makes concise writing extremely important. The software code provided in the Appendix should be clearly commented and easy to follow.

# Questions

1. Can we have more than 2 citation?

2. Our survey uses multi-stage stratified sampling design, selecting county-level PSUs and community-level SSUs using PPS methods, with households sampled in each SSU and one adult per householdselected via the Kish grid. Is it OK for us to treat each observatrion as independent? In other words, do we still need to account for cluster (e.g. county and community)? See sampling design: http://cgss.ruc.edu.cn/English/Documentation/Sampling_Design.htm

# Further steps

1. briefly introduce the theoretical framework of the hypothesis and contribution

2. add citation and abbreviations in the data and method part

3. check sampling weights in the subsets and use sampling weights if allowed

4. polish writing
