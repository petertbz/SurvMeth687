# Introduction


With rising global competition, industrial shifts, and economic recessions, an increasing number of employees face concerns about layoffs. The instability and unpredictability of labor markets impose significant psychological burdens on workers, often resulting in adverse health outcomes linked to job insecurity. Understanding the relationship between job insecurity and health is crucial for informing interventions aimed at improving workers' well-being. Previous research has established a connection between perceived job insecurity and poor health outcomes. After accounting for demographic, socioeconomic, and job characteristics, as well as prior health conditions, perceived job insecurity was found associated with deteriorating health among U.S. workers [@burgard_perceived_2009]. Similarly, McDonough [-@mcdonough_job_2000], using a national sample of Canadian adults, reported that high levels of job insecurity lead to lower self-rated health, increased psychological distress, and increased use of medication for symptom relief.

This study examines the impact of perceived job insecurity on self-rated mental health using data from the 2021 Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS), a nationally representative dataset. Perceived job insecurity arises from subjective experiences and cannot be effectively captured by a single survey item. To address this, we use responses from multiple survey items to construct a latent variable for job insecurity, capturing its complex dynamics, as well as a latent variable for mental health. Utilizing structural equation modeling (SEM), we analyze the relationship between the latent perceived job insecurity and the latent mental well-being.

Within the context of China, we hypothesize the following: 1) perceived job insecurity will be negatively associated with mental well-being indicators, reflecting its detrimental effects on psychological health; 2) the strength of this negative relationship will differ by gender; and 3) the negative relationship will also vary based on whether or not having the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) membership. By testing these hypotheses, this study provides insights into the effects of perceived job insecurity on mental health in a unique cultural setting.

# Data and Methods

## Data

The data used for this analysis is drawn from the 2021 wave of the Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS), the first nationally representative and continuous survey project conducted by an academic institution in mainland China. Since its launch in 2003, the CGSS has been systematically monitoring changes in the relationship between social structure and quality of life across urban and rural areas of China. Social structure in the CGSS encompasses social groups, organizations, and networks of relationships, while quality of life includes both objective measures and subjective perceptions of well-being at both individual and aggregate levels. The 2021 wave of the CGSS provides a rich dataset that is particularly well-suited for this study, offering comprehensive measures of employment conditions, mental health, and demographic factors. Its large-scale, representative sampling ensures that the findings reflect the broader Chinese population, enabling robust analyses of the variations in job insecurity and mental health across different social and economic contexts.

## Measures

Job insecurity is modeled as a latent variable to capture its multidimensional nature, integrating both objective factors (e.g., weekly work hours, employment contract type) and subjective perceptions (e.g., work-related stress, job autonomy, and job satisfaction). 
Treating job insecurity as a latent construct reduces measurement error and focuses on the shared variance across these indicators, ensuring a more robust representation of the underlying concept. For objective measures, weekly work hours reflect the stability and predictability of an individual’s employment. Higher values in this analysis may indicate potential irregularity or overwork, which are linked to greater job insecurity. Employment contract type captures the stability of an individual’s formal employment relationship, with "No contract" representing the most insecure arrangement. The recoded variable is treated as a categorical factor to align with the conceptualization of job insecurity. For subjective measures, job autonomy reflects the degree of control individuals perceive they have over their work processes. Lower autonomy (greater control exerted by others) is associated with higher job insecurity. Work-related stress measures the frequency of stress experienced in the work environment, while job satisfaction reflects the respondent’s overall contentment with their current job. In this analysis, lower satisfaction corresponds to higher levels of job insecurity.

In addition to job insecurity, mental health is treated as a latent variable, measured using three self-reported indicators: feel depressed, feel happy, and health affects work/daily life. These indicators capture distinct yet interrelated dimensions of psychological well-being. The feel depressed indicator reflects the frequency of depressive symptoms, with higher values indicating fewer symptoms and better mental health. Feel happy captures overall emotional positivity, with higher values representing greater happiness. Health affects work/daily life assesses the frequency of health-related disruptions to work or daily activities, with higher values reflecting better perceived health.

To account for potential confounding effects, the analysis includes sex and Chinese Communist Party (CCP) membership as control variables. Sex is included to address potential gender-based differences in job insecurity and mental health outcomes. Party membership distinguishes between CCP members and non-members, focusing on the potential influence of political affiliation on perceptions of job security and well-being.

Table 1 provides a comprehensive overview of the measures for job insecurity, mental health, and control variables. Each variable is categorized as either continuous, ordinal categorical, or binary, reflecting its treatment in the analysis.

###  Analytical approach
\
#### **Model and Estimator**

This analysis employs a structural equation model (SEM) to evaluate the relationship between two latent constructs: perceived job insecurity and mental health. The SEM framework allows the integration of multiple observed indicators into latent constructs, reducing measurement error and providing a robust method for understanding complex relationships.

The Weighted Least Squares Mean and Variance Adjusted (WLSMV) estimator is used for parameter estimation. WLSMV is particularly suited for handling ordinal categorical data, which is common in this study (e.g., indicators such as job satisfaction, work-related stress, and happiness). This estimator accounts for the non-normality of categorical variables, provides robust standard errors, and adjusts chi-square values to better evaluate model fit. These features make WLSMV ideal for models where data includes ordinal or categorical responses. **(add more?)**

#### **Model Structure**

\
The SEM includes two latent constructs:

-   **Job insecurity** : capture its multidimensional nature, integrating both objective factors (e.g., weekly work hours, employment contract type) and subjective perceptions (e.g., work-related stress, job autonomy, and job satisfaction). Treating job insecurity as a latent construct reduces measurement error and focuses on the shared variance across these indicators, ensuring a more robust representation of the underlying concept.

-    **Mental health** : measured using three self-reported indicators (feel depressed, feel happy, and health affects work/daily life). These indicators capture distinct but interrelated dimensions of psychological well-being.

For the SEM model (Figure 1), we primary focus on the path coefficient linking perceived job insecurity and mental health, quantifying the direction and strength of the hypothesized relationship. Factor loadings are evaluated to confirm the validity of latent constructs.

#### **Multiple Group Analysis (MGA)**
\
To explore subgroup differences, multiple group analysis (MGA) was conducted for two key demographic variables: gender (male vs. female) and Chinese Communist Party (CCP) membership (member vs. non-member). The analysis began with baseline model testing, where the model was applied to the full sample to ensure an adequate fit. Model fit was evaluated using standard indices such as chi-square (χ²), RMSEA, CFI, and TLI. This step established the validity of the overall model before proceeding with subgroup comparisons.

The primary focus of the MGA was on comparing the path coefficients between perceived job insecurity and mental health across subgroups. Chi-square difference tests were performed to determine whether the strength of the relationship between the two latent constructs varied significantly by gender or CCP membership. These comparisons provided insights into potential subgroup differences in the impact of perceived job insecurity on mental health.

#### **Survey Weights**
\
Survey weights from the CGSS are used only for descriptive statistics at this stage to ensure the representativeness of the sample. Inferential analyses are conducted without weights, as the WLSMV estimator is robust to sampling variability.

# Results

Table 1 presents the weighted descriptive statistics of the variables used in the analysis. The sample consists of 993 respondents, with an average of 49.92 weekly work hours. A small proportion of respondents have an indefinite term work contract, while the majority have a fixed-term contract. Most respondents report that they have mainly control over their work and are satisfied with their jobs. The majority of respondents report that they rarely or sometimes experience work stress. Regarding mental health, most respondents report that they rarely or sometimes feel depressed and often or always feel happy. The majority of respondents indicate that their health never affects their work or daily life. The sample is almost evenly split by sex, with around 86% of respondents not being members of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

Table 2 presents the results of the structural equation model examining the relationship between perceived job insecurity and mental health, using WLSMV estimation. The model exhibits a Comparative Fit Index (CFI) of 0.94 and a Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) of 0.07, both of which are considered acceptable. For the measurement models, all factor loadings for the latent variable mental health are significant at the 0.01 level, while three out of four factor loadings are significant for the latent variable perceived job insecurity at the 0.1 level. The analysis reveals that perceived job insecurity negatively affects mental health, with a coefficient of -0.11 at the 0.01 significance level. In essence, higher perceived job insecurity correlates with poorer mental health, thereby supporting H1.

Table 3 illustrates the results of the structural equation model that separately evaluates males and females without constraints. This model has a CFI of 0.93 and an RMSEA of 0.07, suggesting an acceptable fit. The findings indicate that perceived job insecurity adversely impacts mental health for both genders. However, the effect is more pronounced for females, with a coefficient of -0.15, compared to males, who have a coefficient of -0.10. To assess whether the relationship between perceived job insecurity and mental health is invariant between males and females, a constrained model equalizing the structural coefficients was tested. Table 4 details the results of the constrained model, which maintains the same CFI of 0.93 and RMSEA of 0.07 as the unconstrained model. Nonetheless, the chi-square test reveals that the constrained model fits significantly worse than the unconstrained model, indicating that the relationship is not invariant across genders. Therefore, females experience a more severe mental health decline due to perceived job insecurity, thus supporting H2.

The relationship between perceived job insecurity and mental health is further analyzed among CCP and non-CCP residents. Table 5 provides the results of the structural equation model for these groups without any constraints. The model reports a CFI of 0.93 and an RMSEA of 0.07, signifying a good fit. The analysis shows that perceived job insecurity has a significantly negative effect on mental health for both CCP and non-CCP residents. However, the negative impact is stronger for non-CCP residents, with a coefficient of -0.12, compared to CCP residents, who have a coefficient of -0.05. To determine whether this relationship is invariant between CCP and non-CCP residents, a constrained model equalizing the structural coefficients was tested. Table 6 presents the results of the constrained model, which also maintains the same CFI of 0.93 and RMSEA of 0.07 as the unconstrained model. However, the chi-square test indicates that the constrained model is significantly worse than the unconstrained model, suggesting that the relationship is not invariant between the two groups. Consequently, non-CCP residents experience a more pronounced decline in mental health due to perceived job insecurity, thereby supporting H3.
